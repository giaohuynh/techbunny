## Launch Azure Cloud Shell

The Azure Cloud Shell is a free Bash shell that you can run directly within the Azure portal. It has the Azure CLI preinstalled and configured to use with your account. Click the **Cloud Shell** button on the menu in the upper-right of the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

If you choose to install and use the CLI locally, this quickstart requires that you are running the Azure CLI version 2.0.12 or later. Run `az --version` to find the version. If you need to install or upgrade, see [Install Azure CLI 2.0]( /cli/azure/install-azure-cli).
